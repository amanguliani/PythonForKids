=Project=
Cows and Bulls Game.


=Description=
Write Code using skeleton or totally on your own a word guessing game.

=Rules=

All words should be 4 character long with no repeated characters. 
(optional) All words should be dictionary word.

The person guessing gets 10 chances to guess the word. 

You should give the person guessing clues to help them.

Clues are given as follows:

if a character in the guessed word is present at the same place as a character in your word it counts as a Bull 
if a character in the guessed word is present but not at the right place as a character in your word it counts as a Cow

For example , if your word is "FORK"

for Guessed word FOUR, your hint would be 2 Bulls (because 'F' and 'O' are at the same position) and 1 Cow (because 'R' exists but is not at its right place)

for next Guessed word KITE, your hint would 1 Cow (because 'K' exists but is not at its right place)


=Code=
You have to write code using skeleton to take input from the user 10 times and give them clues.
You also have to handle cases were person guessing guesses the word and case where they werent able to guess the word in 10 chances.

you can write your code in a text file or colab scratchbook and test it on https://repl.it/
